#### Parallel Visualization of Two Cases:

Create paraview case file by typing:

```
touch $FOAM_RUN/<case>/<case>.OpenFOAM
```
in terminal.


#### Processing in Parallel:

```
decomposePar (-force) in scotch mode
```
Solver execution with 4 processors with progress stored in log00 file:

```
mpirun -np 4 interFoam â€“ parallel > log00 &
```

Reconstruction into time files is done by

```
reconstructPar
```
Delete the Processor Files by

```
rm -r proce*
```

#### Capturing Fluid Flow in 'mpg' File Format:

After the CFD results are captured in \*.jpg files like U.jpg, the pictures 
can be summarized in a mpg file like U.mpg and played with mplayer:

```
mencoder "mf://*.jpg" -mf fps=2 -o U.mpg -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4:autoaspect
mplayer -loop 0 U.mpg
```

Showing only the blockMesh in paraFoam before the simulation is run:
```
paraFoam -block
```

#### Rescale stl files (from mm to m):

```
surfaceTransformPoints -scale '(0.001 0.001 0.001)' input.stl output.stl
```
#### Check Mesh Quality:

```
checkMesh -allGeometry -allTopology
```
#### Check stl file quality

```
surfaceCheck <name>.stl
```
m4 blockMeshDict.m4 > blockMeshDict

#### Procedure to create mesh file with AMI and to check for AMI properties

Make sure that the case has only 0.org and constant/polymesh and 
constant/extendedFeatureEdgeMesh are deleted. The folder constant should only
contain the triSurface folder and the properties files.

```
blockMesh
```
```
mkdir 0
```
```
cp -r constant/polyMesh 0/
```
```
surfaceFeatureExtract
```
```
snappyHexMesh
```
```
createBaffles
```
```
mergeOrSplitBaffles -split
```
```
cp -r <latestTimeFolder>/polyMesh constant/
```
```
checkAMI
```
